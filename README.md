## System Details

![Interactions between litecom2mqtt, Litecom CCD, an MQTT broker, and Home Assistant.](./docs/system.drawio.svg)

## Caveats

-   When setting a value of a device explicitly, Litecom does not propagate that value to its parent hierarchy (i.e., groups, rooms, and zones.).
-   Setting a scene for a room with a Circle device, `activeScene` for that room becomes `null`. üßê Maybe there's a way how we can compensate for this?

## Development

`litecom2mqtt` is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for
NodeJS. You get the best developer experience with
[vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and a
[devcontainer](https://containers.dev/); a
[container configuration](./.devcontainer) is present.

-   https://resources.zumtobel.com/assets/downloads/litecom/manuals/LITECOM_REST_HB_en.pdf

### Update Litecom REST API Client

https://www.npmjs.com/package/openapi-typescript-codegen

1. Download the OpenAPI spec from the Litecom CCD (`https://ADDRESS/docs/rest/`)
   and place it in the projects root as `litecom-openapi.yml`

2. Build the generators Docker image locally, then:

    ```shell
    docker run -v ./:/data openapi-typescript-codegen --input /data/litecom-openapi.yaml --output /data/src/litecom/restClient
    ```

3. Add the `.ts` file extension to all import statements in all files of the
   generated clients. deno needs this.

4. Done.
